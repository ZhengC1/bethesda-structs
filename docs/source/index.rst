Bethesda Structs
================

*A wrapper for some of Bethesda's more popular archive and plugin file formats.*

In my pursuit to create a better method of mod distribution, the issue of processing and accurately representing mods is a major annoyance.
Being able to analyze and potentially discover relationships between Bethesda based mods is something that better mod distribution methods desperately need.

Because of the lack of any **simple** and **lightweight** libraries built to address this issue, I decided to try and handle it myself.

*Please* let me know if you find any issues with my parsing logic as both the documentation and my knowledge on the file formats is very much thrown together.

To get started using this package, please see the :ref:`getting-started` page!
